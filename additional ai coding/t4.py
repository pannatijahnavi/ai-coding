#improvements made
# Original Code	                      Refactored Code
# Uses a for loop	              Uses sum() with generator expressions
# More lines	                           Fewer lines
# Manual addition	                     Built-in sum()
# More repetitive	                      More concise
# Correct but longer	            Correct and maintainable
